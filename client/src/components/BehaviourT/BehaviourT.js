                        <h3>Anger Management</h3>
                        <p>Anger is a powerful human emotion, and it is natural to feel it like any other emotion.
                            Anger is one of the most common human emotions and is as basic as happiness, disappointment, fear or disgust. At some point in life, we all feel frustrated.
                            However, when the extent or severity of anger interferes with relationships, work performance, mental well-being, it becomes problematic.
                            At that moment, we must move towards anger management therapy.</p>
